Added a dynamic temperature system based on biome, light level, sky visibility, rain, water, and bubble columns.
Introduced the "Still Air" block to mimic house insulation under specific conditions.
Implemented a calendar to track days and years in the game, with a year lasting 52 Minecraft days. A day is logged every 20,000 ticks.
Included a work-in-progress UI with limited functionality.

Some features are still in development and may be removed later if deemed unnecessary.
